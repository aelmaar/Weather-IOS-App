> [!Note]
> The iOS simulator doesn't automatically use your current location. You need to manually set a predefined or custom location in the simulator:
> - In the simulator, go to the top menu and select `Features > Location`.
> - Choose from several predefined locations such as "Apple" (Apple's headquarters), "City Run," "Freeway Drive," etc.
> - To set a specific location, select `Custom Location...` and enter the latitude and longitude of the desired location.
> - On a real iPhone device, the app will use your actual current location.
